# Number Guessing Game

This is a simple number guessing game implemented in Python, where the player has to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range.

## How It Works

- The game will randomly pick a number between 1 and 100.
- The player will have to guess the number.
- After each guess, the game will provide feedback:
  - If the guess is too low, it will prompt the player to try again with a higher number.
  - If the guess is too high, it will prompt the player to try again with a lower number.
  - If the guess is correct, the game will congratulate the player and tell them how many attempts it took.

- The player can choose to play multiple rounds or exit the game.
